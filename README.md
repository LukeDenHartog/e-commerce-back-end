## Description

This project is the back end for an e-commerce site. It's a Express.js API that uses the Sequelize ORM to interact with a MySQL database. It uses the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from the database.

## Installation

To install this project please clone the GitHub repository. After cloning the repo the user should run the following text `npm install` into the terminal to download the necessary node packages. Users should also create their own ".env" file inside the project folder.  There's a example on how users should create the .env file in the file named ".env.EXAMPLE". MySQL is also required and should be downloaded before attempting to run the program. Lastly you should seed the database by running "node seeds" in the terminal.

## Usage

To use this application you first have to follow the installation instructions in the README file and make sure you have a MySQL server started. To start your MySQL server, insert this command into the Terminal `mysql.server start`. Once you finish all previous steps run the command `npm run start`. The user can now make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to perform CRUD operations.
